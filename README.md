project-owl_android
===================
A native Android mobile application that complements Project Owl. Because
this is experimental at the moment, I'm not sure how far this will go yet.

You can find the original web application here:
https://github.com/IsaacLean/project-owl

I'm using this project mainly for learning purposes with programming,
application design, cloud platforms, Git, and more, so please excuse any
newbie mistakes. I'm open to advice and critiques so contact me if you have
any!
